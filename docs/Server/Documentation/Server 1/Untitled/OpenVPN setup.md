destroys current config and initiates new one from scratch
```
ovpn-init
```

check username (openvpn default) and password (autogenerated after version ?) all the way down  
then login with it on serverIP:port/admin (192.168.x.x:943/admin) - specified in init.log file
```
sudo cat /usr/local/openvpn_as/init.log
```  

log in as admin and add new user with wanted permissions (TOTO is two factor authentication),
then go to 192.168.x.x:943 - specified in init.log file , and log in as user. download config for your device and run it
